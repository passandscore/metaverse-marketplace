<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Implemented a NFT based Dapp application using Next.js and Matic's Mumbai testnet. The purpose of the application is give users the ability to create digital assets (NFTs). They then have the option to place those assets on the marketplace for purchasing. 


## What I learned 
This was my first time implementing Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Hardhat and the Mumbai testnest. Fortunantley for me, the documentation was well put together. I found that these techonolgies really worked well together. Hardhat made smart contract deployment a breeze while nest.js and tailwind simplified the frontend process.
